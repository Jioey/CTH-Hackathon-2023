## Inspiration
Friend getting food stamps, awareness of food programs, and social justice program problems.

## What it does
Users enter baseline information about their socio-economic status, and the software outputs lists of eligible support programs.

## How we built it
Using HTML, JavaScript, X Code, and Wix

## Challenges we ran into
Extremely limited web development expertise, difficult-to-navigate program websites, and lots of permutations resulting in confusing if-else statements.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Functional HTML website and cool Wix and ios applications.

## What we learned
Basics of web development, issues of the American social support programs, and better collaborating with people from different fields of study.

## What's next for NavigAid
Extending the database on available programs, extending nationwide, better algorithms, and extending to resources more than food.
